            <p class="frame1">Hello, and welcome to Kai's weeb corner!</p>
            <p class="frame2">
              Here, I will introduce you to my top 5 anime picks, and give you a
              little insight in what anime is all about. Maybe I will even teach
              you some terminology within the anime community, or inspire you to
              find something that might peak your interest.
            </p>
            <p class="frame3">But first of all, what is anime?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            <p class="frame4">
              Typically, most people use the term to refer to hand&hyphen;drawn
              and computer&hyphen;generated animation originating from Japan,
              such as Pok√©mon, Naruto, Yu&hyphen;Gi&hyphen;Oh&#33; and Dragon
              Ball Z, to name a few. However, in Japan, the term is used as an
              abbreviation of the english term <i>'Animation'</i> and is a
              general term for anything that has been animated, regardless of
              origin.<br /><br />
              Simply put, that means that Anime is anything that's been
              animated.
            </p>
            <p class="frame5">
              So why then did I call this page <i>'The lost Artform'?</i>

        <div class="container-text">
          <div class="text">
            <p class="frame6">Well, that's simple!</p>
            <p class="frame7">
              Most people have either read a comic book, graphic novel, or
              watched a cartoon or animated movie that wasn't created digitally
              &mdash; whether it was Disney movies running in the background, or
              actively looking for something to watch.
            </p>
            <p class="frame8">
              For me, it was always the latter. But we are getting further and
              further away from a world where these things are done manually,
              and comics themselves are no longer as wide spread as they once
              were.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            <p class="frame9">
              I'm sure you've figured it out by now, but the point is that
              there's not a lot of media that uses hand&hyphen;drawn art to
              create something in our modern day world, and while a lot of anime
              has also implemented a great deal of digital art, the fact of the
              matter is that there's still a lot of actual drawing that goes
              into making it, and more often than not, the results of this
              painstaking process is simply amazing to watch.<br />
              <br />
              And, in my opinion, that is a very underappreciated artform.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            <p class="frame10">
              Thinking about it, maybe calling it the lost artform wasn't the
              best choice. But it is one of the last of its kind, and I for one
              hope that never changes.
            </p>

              <b>Demon Slayer</b> is a fairly new anime, but it has quickly
              risen to become my most recommended anime. Partly because the
              artwork itself is absolutely outstanding, where it draws
              inspiration from traditional Japanese art, mixes it with mordern
              digital animation, as well as uses hand&hyphen;drawn animation.
              <br />
              <br />I cannot sing this anime's praises enough, as it embodies
              everything that I enjoy about an anime.

              It follows the story of Tanjiro Kamado, who strives to become a
              demon hunter after his entire family is brutally slaughtered, and
              his younger sister, Nezuko, becomes a demon.<br />
              However, unlike most other demons, she seems capable of
              recognizing friend from foe, and together they try to find a way
              to return her to her human self. Granted, she can't speak and he
              has to have her locked in a wooden box that he carries with him,
              but she doesn't let her new demon blood deter her from protecting
              those she loves.

            <img class="img5" src="images/Zen.webp" />
            <p class="frame14">
              On their journey, they meet some rather extraordinary people,
              among whom are Zenitsu Agatsuma, a seemingly timid and cowardly
              hopeless romantic who falls in love with every girl he sees; and
              Inosuke Hashibara, a strange looking guy with a boar&hyphen;head
              and an intelligence to match. <br />
              <br />
              None of them are people to take lightly, though, as they have
              their own unique strengths that just makes them a whole new level
              of bad&hyphen;ass.<br /><br />
              But what makes this anime so good, is very much in part of how
              well the four main characters work together. Between the very
              serious and sad story, there's light hearted humor and the dynamic
              that the characters provide is simply sublime.<br /><br />
              On top of that, the show is very well balanced over all, regarding
              pacing, character building, humor and anime stereotypes. It
              doesn't take itself so serious that it becomes weird and hard to
              watch, but it also isn't so absurd that you can't take it serious.

              <b>Tokyo Ghoul</b> is right up there as my favorite of all times,
              but it does have its issues in later seasons, and I much prefer
              the manga &#40;the Japanese 'comic' of the story.&#41;<br />
              <br />
              That said, it is also one of the more brutal ones out there, in
              terms of emotional attachments, story and gore, and those who do
              end up liking it, also tend to get an extreme attachment to the
              anime, for good reason.<br /><br />
              I am no exception to that.

          <div class="text">
            <p class="frame17">
              This story follows Ken Kaneki, a shy and introverted student who
              gets in a terrible accident after going on a date with a young
              woman he's had a crush on for a while. But when the night comes to
              an end, and she reveals her true self, they both get crushed under
              a steel beam that falls from a crane at a construction site
              nearby. This results in serious injury to the both of them, and
              the only way to save Kaneki's life, is to use her organs to
              replace his, turning Kaneki into a half&hyphen;ghoul.
            </p>
            <p class="frame18">
              Naturally, that takes him through some life&hyphen;changing
              realizations, and he struggles to come to terms with his new
              existence. In his search for answers, he comes across a caffee
              that serves the only human&hyphen;made consumable that he can
              stomach, and learns that all the people working there are also
              ghouls.
            </p>
            <p class="frame19">
              In the start of the series, we follow Kaneki as he learns his new
              world, and struggles with keeping himself sane while also keeping
              his friends safe and not consuming a living human, and the show
              doesn't hide the brutality of the ghoul society, both among those
              who don't eat live humans, and those who hunt humans for sport.
              But in the background, we also get a glimpse of the special forces
              tasked with dealing with the ghouls, and once again, the story
              shows no mercy in the methods of which certain things are
              handled.<br /><br />
              Overall, the show is not for the faint of heart, and pulls on
              heartstrings that can rip your soul to pieces, if you are able to
              keep up and follow along.

            <p class="frame20">
              Which brings me to the problems of the anime. <br /><br />
              Most people I've talked to, either hate or love the anime, as it's
              very hard to keep up and the story bounces between information
              that doesn't seem relevant, and leaves out information that isn't
              obvious at first glance. The mental strain that happens to Kaneki,
              changes who he is in more ways than one, and that doesn't come
              across as well in the anime as it should. <br /><br />Even so, I
              highly reccomend watching or reading it.
